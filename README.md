# AlphaSplitter

Ab initio discovery of satellite DNA monomer alphabets from tandem repeat arrays.

AlphaSplitter identifies periodic conserved anchor sites in satellite DNA, assembles them into chain templates, and classifies monomers by structural indels — without reference HMMs, curated databases, or prior knowledge of the satellite family.

## Quick Start

AlphaSplitter is a single `alphasplitter` CLI with subcommands. Build once, then invoke.

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release          # or: make

# End-to-end pipeline (discover → cut → annotate)
./target/release/alphasplitter run arrays.10kb.fasta -o results/ -t 96

# Or stage-by-stage
./target/release/alphasplitter discover arrays.10kb.fasta -o chains.json -t 96
./target/release/alphasplitter cut      arrays.10kb.fasta -m chains.json -o monomers.tsv -t 96
./target/release/alphasplitter annotate monomers.tsv annotated.tsv
```

Run `alphasplitter --help` for the full subcommand list; every subcommand takes `--help` as well. `make run INPUT=arrays.10kb.fasta OUTDIR=results THREADS=96` is the Makefile shortcut for the end-to-end path.

## What it does

**Input:** FASTA of satellite DNA arrays (e.g., from [Satellome](https://github.com/ad3002/satellome) or TRASH).

**Output (under `-o <outdir>`):**
- `chains.json` — per-SF motif bundles with claimed array membership
- `monomers.tsv` — one row per monomer: `family`, `array_id`, coords, `letter`, `subtype`, `site_order`, `site_structure`, sequence
- `monomers_hor.tsv` — HOR strings per array
- `annotated.tsv` — `monomers.tsv` + CENP-B columns
- `families.json` — per-family alphabet report
- `family_consensus.fa` — one consensus per (family, letter)
- `letters/<family>/<letter>.tsv` — all monomers of each letter, one row per monomer (sequence first, then metadata) — ready to feed into muscle/hmmbuild

## Core Model

A satellite monomer is a chain of conserved anchor sites separated by variable spacers:

```
[--site_A--]---spacer---[--site_B--]---spacer---[--site_C--]...
  conserved    LENGTH      conserved    LENGTH     conserved
  sequence     matters!    sequence     matters!   sequence
```

**Letter** = defined by indels only (which sites are present/deleted + spacer length changes), NOT by substitutions. Letters are assigned locally within each SF family: "A" in `P171SF0` is not the same object as "A" in `P171SF1`; the `family` column disambiguates.

**Site presence detection:** a site is present if the distance between its neighbors matches expected — no fuzzy sequence matching needed.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `run` | End-to-end: discover → cut → annotate |
| `discover` | Chain-first anchor discovery + enrichment + multi-SF/period |
| `cut` | Array → monomers, letter/subtype classification, per-letter dumps |
| `annotate` | Add CENP-B box columns to a monomers TSV |
| `find-box` | Search for any degenerate box pattern (CENP-B, TIGD4, etc.) |
| `spacing` | CENP-B box spacing analysis at single-base resolution |
| `find-periodic-boxes` | De novo periodic box discovery from paired k-mers |
| `reads {build-hmms,scan,classify,extract,alphabet}` | ONT read processing (HPC-HMM workflow) |
| `dev {find-phase,motif-graph}` | Hidden research subcommands |

Alexandrov validation: 38/39 SF types recovered, 96.3% of monomers assigned.

## Key Findings

- **585 structural letter types** in human alpha satellite (15× more than HumAS-HMMER's 39)
- **CENP-B variable positions** are chromosome-specific suprachromosomal family markers
- **CENP-B spacing within CDR** = chromosome-specific nucleosome positioning signature
- **Mouse centromeric satellite saturated** with CENP-B boxes (89% of monomers)
- **Zebra finch has two alternative box systems** (BoxA-D at 355bp, TIGD4 at 715bp) on different chromosomes
- **Convergent architecture**: human (340bp), ZF (355bp), mouse (120bp) → 1 box ≈ 1 nucleosome repeat
